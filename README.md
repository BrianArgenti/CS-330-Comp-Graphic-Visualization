   # CS-330: Computer Graphics Visualization

Welcome to the **CS-330: Computer Graphics Visualization** repository! This project focuses on recreating a 3D scene from a 2D reference image using the **OpenGL** API. Below, you'll find insights on the software design process, development approach, and how computer science concepts can help achieve future goals.

## 1. How I Approach Designing Software
I start by clearly defining the problem at hand and researching the tools that can help solve it. In this project, the goal was to interpret a 2D image and build a fully realized 3D scene. By understanding the problem deeply and leveraging the **OpenGL** API, I could plan an **iterative design process**:

- **Break It Down**: I divided the overall project into smaller tasks.  
- **Iterate & Improve**: After completing each small task, I evaluated and improved it before moving on.  
- **Build Up**: Each completed piece contributed to the final 3D scene.  

This step-by-step methodology promotes a focused workflow and reduces the risk of errors. It’s a strategy I find indispensable for producing elegant and well-organized solutions, regardless of the project size.

## 2. How I Approach Developing Programs
My development process centers on clean, modular code and frequent testing:

1. **Modular Functions**: I created specialized functions to handle specific tasks (e.g., transformations, rendering, or loading textures). This approach not only keeps the codebase organized but also makes these functions reusable in future projects.  
2. **Frequent Iteration**: Writing small chunks of code and testing them early allows me to catch mistakes quickly and avoid large-scale rewrites.  

By continuously integrating and reviewing these smaller pieces, I ensure that each module works reliably and contributes effectively to the larger application.

## 3. How Computer Science Helps Reach My Goals
This course sharpened my abilities to think **spatially** and **geometrically**. Through implementing translations, rotations, and scalings of objects in OpenGL, I gained a deeper understanding of how shapes interact in 3D space. These skills will be invaluable for:

- **Creating Visually Appealing Applications**: Whether I’m building interactive visualizations, games, or web experiences, knowing how to manipulate 2D and 3D objects can set my work apart.
- **Problem-Solving in Other Domains**: The methodical and spatial thinking developed here applies to a wide range of technical challenges, from UI/UX design to data visualization.
